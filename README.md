# ASCIIProgram
Small program that cyphers and decyphers characters into ASCII
I followed a step by step tutotrial that taught me how to create a program to convert alphabetic character input into their ASCII equivalents in output. Once I understood how this was done, 
I used the same concepts and wrote a program that would take ASCII number values and return the alphabetic equivalent.
